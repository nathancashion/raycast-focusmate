# Email Draft to FocusMate Developers

**Subject:** Raycast Extension Development & API Enhancement Request

Hi FocusMate Team,

I hope this email finds you well! I'm a FocusMate user who recently built a Raycast extension to integrate with your platform, and I wanted to share what I've accomplished while also exploring some potential enhancements.

## What I've Built
Using your public API (https://api.focusmate.com/v1), I've created a Raycast extension that:
- Displays upcoming sessions with partner details and session status
- Provides quick access to join active sessions
- Opens the FocusMate web app for session scheduling
- Includes a "Focus Now" feature that guides users to start instant sessions

The extension works great for viewing sessions, but I ran into some limitations that made me curious about future possibilities.

## API Enhancement Requests
Would you consider supporting these features in your public API?

1. **POST /sessions endpoint** - Allow programmatic session scheduling (currently read-only)
2. **Focus Now API** - Enable instant session creation without manual clicking
3. **Session cancellation** - Support canceling sessions via API calls

These would enable much richer integrations and workflows for power users.

## Official Raycast Extension?
Given Raycast's growing popularity among developers and productivity enthusiasts (many of whom are likely FocusMate users), would you be interested in creating an official FocusMate extension? I'd be happy to share my code as a starting point, or collaborate on an official version.

## Current Extension
If you're curious to see what I've built, I can share the code or demonstrate the functionality. It's been a fun project that's already improving my own FocusMate workflow!

Thanks for building such a valuable platform for focused work. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The API documentation at https://apidocs.focusmate.com/ was very helpful, though I did notice it could benefit from some examples showing required query parameters like `start` and `end`.
